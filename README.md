# CadeMeuPet a.k.a WhereIsMyPet
This was a project made on my third year of university, based on an idea to generate/monetize Pet Tags with QR Code that would allow showing more detailed information of a pet with a notification system that would notify an owner if their pet qr code was scanned(and showed a map with the location).
